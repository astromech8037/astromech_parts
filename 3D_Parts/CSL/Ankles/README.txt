This folder contains all files needed to produce the CSL Outer and Center ankles.

For the outer ankles, you have two choices of files.
OuterAnkle_CSL_Bearking:  	This type uses a ball bearing at the joint
OuterAnkle_CSL_ThroughHole:	This type has a straight through bore.  Be sure to grease
				the shoulder bolt to ensure no seizure.
