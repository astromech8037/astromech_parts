Please note that CSR center ankles do not exist.  Please see https://astromech.net for more details.

For the outer ankles, you have two choices of files.
OuterAnkle_CSR_Bearking:  	This type uses a ball bearing at the joint
OuterAnkle_CSR_ThroughHole:	This type has a straight through bore.  Be sure to grease
