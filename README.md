# Astromech Parts

This is my collection of astromechs.  
For more details on these parts, as well blueprints and general information on how to build a astromech droid, please visit https://astromech.net  

The GitHub repository will be split into the following areas:

3D Files:  This area will contain all 3D files I have created.  Each piece will have a readme with the best way to produce the file (ie:  3D printing, CNC, etc)

Electronics:  This area will contain all the electronics I have created.   In addition, any code for running the electronics will be here.

Happy building!
